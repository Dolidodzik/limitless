100 - 0 progress validation
CLEANUP OVERALL
replace warning console.log with actually sending information back to client
chunk size as global setting, file id length etc.
tech allowing sender to select which users should receive file he's sending
pausing breaking etc edge cases connection during upload or not, during offer sent, during everything
// better validating offers like here:
    else if (isJsonString(data)) 
      data = JSON.parse(data);
      if(data && data.totalChunks && data.size){ // checking if data is valid offer, or at least looks like it
        console.log("file offer json string received ", data)
      }else{
        console.log("WRONG JSON STRING RECEIVED ", data)
      }
Dealing with offers JSON stringing etc in a better way
